## In the Moment Overview
The project addresses the theme of ‘Collective Action’ and interprets it in the context of an event and activity recommendation application to encourage lifestyle enrichment in young workaholics. ‘In the Moment’ is a mobile application that uses collective data to drive personalised event and activity recommendations for individuals based on their time, location and selected areas of interest. 

It builds upon existing event recommendation models on sites such as Eventbrite, Facebook Local and Meetup, and takes it a step further in using collective data to curate a selection of activities to the user. It primarily focuses on collecting user data to inform recommendation choices, and supplements the recommendation-generation process with web-scraping technology.
