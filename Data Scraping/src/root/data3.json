Are you ready? \n REVEL presents PINOT PALOOZA.\n Pinot Palooza is back for its biggest year yet, touring 11 cities in five countries. That\u2019s Perth, Adelaide, Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Singapore and, for the first time, Tokyo and Hong Kong!\nSo, no matter where you live, it\u2019s time to grab your friends and let your taste buds loose over some of the finest wines produced in the world!\nPinot Palooza is wine that ROCKS. Our line-up of Pinot producers are the best from Australia, New Zealand and beyond. So come, soak up the music and drink your way across the globe.\nAll tickets include an epic take home wine glass and unlimited wine tastes. NO TOKENS.\nLimited VIP Tickets tickets are also available. The format for VIPS is a little different this year - there's no separate day, or early start, but the entire event has been extended to run from 11am - 6pm. You'll get a glass of fizz on arrival, a dedicated lounge area with exclusive offerings, plus more TBA. \nThis event sells out every year so be sure to get in quick!\nPINOT PALOOZA: COMING TO A CITY NEAR YOU!\n #pinotpalooza\n\nTICKETING FAQs\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\nYes please. As alcohol is at the event, you must be over 18 to attend. Please bring a valid form of identification with you on the day just to be sure (Passport or driving license).\nAre children permitted at the event?\nThis is always a tough one. Whilst the answer is a non discriminatory \u2018yes\u2019, our events are often very busy, loud and a little hectic so not an ideal place for little people. We suggest getting a baby sitter and having the day off. We\u2019ll bring the wine. \nWill tickets be available on the door?\nOnly if there are any available. But more often than not, \u2018no\u2019 as the events sell out prior. We cap numbers to ensure everyone has a great time and it\u2019s not too crazy as we want you coming back. We strongly suggest buying tickets prior to ensure you don\u2019t miss out.\nIs there a refund policy?\nRefunds are available on all tickets up to 30 days prior to the event. After that date, no dice sorry. If after that time, it\u2019s always good to check on the event pages as often people are looking to purchase ones if the event is sold out.\nI haven\u2019t received my ticket? What do I do?\nAn automated email is sent upon purchasing tickets. If you don\u2019t receive it, it could be for a couple of reasons. Firstly, check the spam folder as sometimes they get stuck there. Other times, when in a rush to purchase (!), some accidentally enter their email address incorrectly. If that\u2019s the case, drop us an email and we\u2019ll search and resend. But all good, you\u2019ll be in our system.\nDo I need to print the tickets.\nIt\u2019s always easier, yes. But, even better is the eventbrite app which keeps them all on your phone. We\u2019ll scan you in when you arrive.\nTasting, not drinking!\nWe like to think of these events as a tasting, not a drinking as we want you to experience as many different wine styles on offer. Creating a safe, welcoming and non-intimidating event environment is what we\u2019re all about so any inappropriate behaviour, of an intoxicated nature or not, that is dangerous to yourself and or others, is just not acceptable.\nWe have a strict \u2018no d*$%head\u2019 policy so if we witness any of the above, we reserve the right to take appropriate action and have you removed from the venue.\nI\u2019ve got a couple of other random questions, what should I do?\nEasy. Drop us an email at cheers@revel.global and we\u2019ll get right back to you.\n",

Join us for this special screening presented in Brisbane by Urban Climb which will include event stalls and on stage introduction to the most anticipated climbing film ever made.\nIn January, 2015, American rock climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captivated the world with their effort to climb the Dawn Wall, a seemingly impossible 3,000 foot rock face in Yosemite National Park, California. The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention.\nBut for Tommy Caldwell, the Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing the Dawn Wall.  Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship? \nMore than just a climbing movie, THE DAWN WALL is an epic and inspirational story that will take you into the hearts and minds of the protagonists and is to be enjoyed by all.\nWINNER OF THE AUDIENCE AWARD AT SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST.

        "description": "\nJoin Leigh Sales, host of ABC\u2019s 7.30, in-conversation with Sarah Kanowski as she discusses her new book, Any Ordinary Day.\nAs a journalist, Leigh Sales often encounters people experiencing the worst moments of their lives in the full glare of the media. But one particular string of bad news stories \u2013 and a terrifying brush with her own mortality \u2013 sent her looking for answers about how vulnerable each of us is to a life-changing event. What are our chances of actually experiencing one? What do we fear most and why? And when the worst does happen, what comes next?  In this wise and layered book, Leigh talks intimately with people who\u2019ve faced the unimaginable, from terrorism to natural disaster to simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Expecting broken lives, she instead finds strength, hope, even humour. Leigh brilliantly condenses the cutting-edge research on the way the human brain processes fear and grief, and poses the questions we too often ignore out of awkwardness. Along the way, she offers an unguarded account of her own challenges and what she\u2019s learned about coping with life\u2019s unexpected blows.\nBooks will be available for purchase on the night, or bring your copy from home for Leigh to sign. \nPresented as part of the Lord Mayor\u2019s Writers in Residence series.\nWeekday parking after 4.30pm is available at King George Square Car Park for $5.\n",
