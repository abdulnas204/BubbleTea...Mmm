They were only careful with what they allowed me to see on official VHS.  If it was on television it was edited, so they were fine with it.  Even if the movies still weren't 100% appropriate even when edited.  \nRemember, in the 80's and 90's options for seeing films after they left theaters were limited.  Movies were replayed on television all the time back then.  Once 8pm hit on a Friday or Saturday night, ABC, NBC, FOX, and pretty much every cable channel showed a movie instead television shows like now.  And that included a lot of R rated films that were edited for television.  Because of that, a lot of R rated films were also marketed towards children.  I had toys from Alien, Predator, Terminator, Robocop, etc. at like 7 years old, and by that time had also seen all of those films in their edited versions.  I mean, I'd probably even seen the entirety of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween series by 10.  I know AMC still plays those films in October, but these were being played on network channels back then.  \nIt was a different time than today.",

By the time I decide on what I want to watch most nights before bed I realize it's too late and just put on an episode of Frasier for the 100th time.  \nIt sucks for kids too because you can't stream Robocop for a 6 year old.

Not only is this going to be in news in USA, this shall be on every major broadcaster around the world. Head of state of USA, Russia, China etc. speaking in UN session will get nightly news coverage around the world.\n\u200b\nWhich is why it was amazing people laughed. Remember these are diplomats. Trained to maintain decorum at all times, because the whole world is watching the UN session. Outside of single rival nation protesting, usually UN head of state of speeches are listened with dead silence, zero reaction and official applause at the end. Which means.... You have to say something absolute ridiculous to get laughter out of these people.\n\u200b\nTheir diplomatic instinct is to keep their mouths shut and then among their own delegation behind closed doors laugh and joke about the idiotic shit said. Specially with so called big nation speaking. Usually people wouldn't dare laugh in case that would cause rift in diplomatic ties.",

He cozied up to the Clintons for a decade straight, and never demonstrated a conservative bone in his body. Yes, he was always narcassistic and racist, but his beliefs were straight opposite of the mainstream republican positions in almost every way. He was almost entirely areligious, pro-choice, pro-big government, and was even a big fan of taxing the rich. \nBut after Obama got elected, he started reinventing himself to position for a run. The birther shit, the anti-immigration shit, the anti-trade shit, all of it came out of nowhere. He literally just made up a new persona and started selling it to rubes. And it sadly worked.",

I bought a pair of concert tickets for a show at a small music club without waiting to confirm schedules with my wife or my one go-to friend for these sorts of things. I wasn't concerned because the tickets weren't very expensive and I knew they would sell fast.\nOf course neither of their schedules worked out, and the process I went through to find someone else to come with made it very much apparent to me that I need to make it a personal goal to reconnect with old friends, and to proactively maintain friendships. Even just texting with a bunch of old friends over the last week has improved my outlook on life, and it's really hit home how easy it is to let go of all that when you are trying to chase career success while having a busy family.",

Things like Radio GAGA, You're My Best Friend, Mr Fahrenheit, Crazy Little Thing Called Love [thought it was Elvis, Freddie wrote it as a tribute to Elvis, in ten minutes while he was in the bath], I Want it Now etc. They have such a wide and varied catalogue, there is always more to discover.\nMy favourite song is Somebody to Love, written by Freddie, it was his favourite too, but he never said as he didn't want to appear arrogant.\nIt was so sad seeing him decline, and this post reminded me of him. There is a biopic coming out in November, it should be good, even though I can't get out of my head that it's Rami Malek playing Freddie. The other band members are so spot on.",

I started a YouTube channel when I was 12 and we would send each other messages on there since YouTube had a pretty cool DM system back then. \nWhen I turned 13 I got a Facebook and when he got one we added each other on there and that pretty much helped our friendship grow since we stopped playing club penguin. \nHe was with me through a lot of my edgy years and put up with a lot of my teen angst and depression which looking back on it now makes me understand how lucky I am I didn\u2019t scare him off.\nOur friendship continued to grow when we both got ps3s and would play Little Big Planet 2 and Uncharted 2 & 3 together. There\u2019s actually still clips on my old YouTube channel of us playing co-op missions. \nSo time went on and we still kept talking and finally, this last summer my boyfriend and I made a trip up to North Carolina so I could meet my boyfriend\u2019s sister, but I made time to make a detour to the city my friend lived in. It was an amazing experience. We hung out the whole day and acted like we weren\u2019t separated by distance for so many years. It was an experience I\u2019ll never forget.\nHe plans to come visit me in Louisiana next summer. I can\u2019t wait for that either C:",

We told his family who we were and they were so happy to see us because they heard so much about us and how happy he was when talking about gaming with us. I forget how many but a few flew out for his funeral when the time came. One of our friends read a letter written by someone who couldn\u2019t make it.

We all loved the game, and continued to play together through the franchise.  We were all a bit younger then (I am 48 now, most of us are in our 40s now), and some of us were married, some were not.  Some had kids, some didn't.  but that never mattered, because we became friends through a team-playing game, and it became so much more. \nSoon we were talking on the phone to each other.  Then it was Christmas cards and gifts for each others's kids during the holidays and birthdays.\nIn time many of us traveled on vacations and made our friends' home a destination.  Some of us started businesses, and looked to each other to help because we had people in professions that would compliment each other (I started a computer company, and one of the guys did graphic design and made my logos, while another did web work and helped me do my website).\nSome of are EMTs out saving lives and using the rest of us to decompress when he has had a particularly hard day losing a child to a drunk driving accident...\nAnother has had his wife diagnosed with cancer, and we are all there for him to help him through the tough times, as well as give him and his wife a place to come visit when she is feeling well.\nWe have lost parents and grieved together, we have watched some of us get married, and have kids and celebrated that.  We have supported one who had a divorce and helped him keep his shit together as his world fell apart around him.\nWay back in the day, when the Internet (mainly the web, and IRC) was brand new, you would hear of people meeting online and think to yourself \"that is crazy, I would never go and meet some crazy person online\".  these days, it seems like meeting in the street and creating a friendship.\nI am truly blessed with the friends I have made online.  We are a part of each other's lives in a way that is no different from going to school, or having a neighbor that continues to be a friend.\nThe next stages for us will be having our kids go up and out of the house, and I am sure we will all talk, visit and console each other as we feel that 'empty nest' as our next stage takes hold.\nCherish your friends.  They can come from the most unexpected places, and if you would have asked me 15 years ago if I would still be talking to these guys.....I don't know what I would have said, but I am happy to say today, \"hell yes, most of us talk every single day either in a game, or on the phone\".  And I look forward to their  family Christmas cards every year.",

We ended up in the sane program at the same college and starting a business together. Still talk daily and hang out when we can.\nI think this is awesome OP and makes me smile.

I've been drawn to this particular set of Hills because it was apparently some of the toughest downhill skiing in New England, and being from Nebraska, I have done an awful lot of downhill skiing.....but hills were the bunny variety (according to my northern and eastern friends, not at all in a patronizing way, the dicks). Anyway, my friends in Vermont all went back to the Chalet we were renting, but I wanted to stay out and try some more difficult Hills, because I had one hell of a false sense of security from dealing with blue squares like an Olympian. I ended up getting stuck in the middle of a double black diamond course, not able to bring myself to what looked like a straight veritcal drop. Out of nowhere skiis this Scottish fellow who looks, and comports, himself like landed Gentry, compliments my bravery, and then shows me the easiest way to make it down the hill. I absolutely bring him back to our Chalet, and the friends, him, and I get well and properly sauced.  \nUnfortunately that was about the time one of our party suggest we go out skiing \"because you're more relaxed when you've been drinking, and can absorb the shock much better\". That's where my friend broke both legs, and this old dude went from savior earlier to outright badass, helping us desend.  we had some pretty good pictures of him and us, and wanted to send him something as a thank you after the fact, so got his address. In the meantime, while waiting for the photos to develop, my friend with the shattered legs pick up a wicked oxy habit. And when they ran out, an aquaintence of his from high school gave him some pills that ended up being particularly strong heroin. He overdosed. I wasn't sure if I should include this when I sent the photos and the thank you note, but ended up telling him. his response was nothing but courteous and kind, giving advice and condolences to more or less strangers. I'll never forget though, he said there's nothing we could do. It was a slippery slope.",

These firefighters weren't rushing in to save beloved human-bonded pets, they were rushing in to save other people's assets and the owner showed their appreciation and gratitude by sending a portion of the saved assets to them as gifts.\nSome people like PETA would object to seeing animals as assets, and that's another can of worms entirely.",

The bus was travelling at a speed of approximately 100 km/h.[7] Most of the dead and injured were teenagers from the Humboldt Broncos, a junior ice hockey team that plays in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL).",

It will be an intense sadness that wouldn't trade for anything in the world.\nI will probably go on to have more pets after that.

This one is specifically trained for PTSD and the aftermath of such events. He can sense when his handler is thinking about the event or something bad and will attempt to distract him and turn his attention towards the dog. They\u2019re truly outstanding animals and I\u2019m sure this young mans life will be drastically improved once he gets full possession of the dog. \nThe organization giving him the training to handle the dog and continue training the dog is Courageous Companions ( http://courageouscompanions.ca/ ) They specialize in providing the right training to the handler and the dog so that they become a strong team. It\u2019s important to constantly work on that bond between handler and dog because it\u2019s that connection that makes the dog know when and what\u2019s wrong. He is specifically trained for this man\u2019s type of PTSD and other such issues.\nThese two companies provided my dad with his service dog and gave him the knowledge he needed to know to keep himself and his dog as connected as possible. They have essentially saved my dad\u2019s life and I am forever grateful or their help with making sure he can still live a life as normal as possible. If you get the chance, go and check out their websites! They\u2019re outstanding organizations that are changing peoples lives for the better!",

In the video, the dog isn't actually \"hugging\" he's applying pressure to certain points that calm the handler. :) \n2. Retrieval. If I was having a horrible panic attack, she would bring my pill bottle and a water bottle. It's amazing how adaptive they are, one time she grabbed an empty bottle and every time after that she would shake it to see if it rattled. \n3. Barrier/buffer. I had a very active role in her training because there was a local training facility, and this was something I wanted her to learn, but she did it instinctively! If someone came to close to me, she would stand between us and make them back up if she felt that it made me anxious.\n4. \"Get help.\" If we were in public and something happened, she was trained to stay by my side and perform the deep pressure therapy unless I said \"Get help.\" Then she would walk to the nearest person and paw at them and lead them to me. If she didn't see anyone nearby, she would bark. It was pretty cool that she even timed her barks. Like, bark, ten seconds pass, bark again, ten seconds pass, until someone came.\nShe was the absolute best dog I ever had, and I miss her a lot but at this point I feel that my conditions are manageable enough without getting another service dog. Plus my cats act as \"emotional support animals\" (no training, provide comfort just by being around, does NOT have the same rights as a service dog btw)",

Just wanted to chime in and explain why these policies exist, as it was explained to me years ago:\nThe idea is that if a student can't receive lower than a 50 per marking period, there is never a point where it is impossible for them to pass for the year. Technically, they could not show up for three quarters, pull a 100 in the fourth, and still pass for the year. \nNow, an optimist would say this is a good thing, as it means the students will always have that opportunity to make a comeback. Particularly in low-income districts that lack parent engagement, the last thing you want is a kid realizing they can't possibly pass for the year and deciding to spend their day on the street instead of wasting it in school. I've seen firsthand students who really only kept coming to class because they still had that chance -- however small -- to pass for the year.\nThe more pessimistic view is what many have already pointed out in these comments: that it allows schools to keep pushing students through the system without actually teaching them anything, artificially inflating graduation rates and making admin look good. I've also seen this first hand, as well as the fallout when it was discovered by the school board.\nPersonally speaking, I'm not a fan of giving a student a 50 for doing nothing. I understand there are specific scenarios where a student misses a large amount of work due to crisis or injury, and that should not destroy all of their previous work. However, I think exceptions can be made for those scenarios without being codified as the mandatory grading policy. But, every school I've worked in has had some policy like this, so unfortunately it seems like it's becoming more common.",

If they did stay late, they usually had no way of getting home because the bus was their only way.\nAlso, most of them had shit parents who wouldn't return my calls, but funny enough I'd get a ton of calls when I tried to keep their kid after school.

                "comment_text": "I had a student who showed up twice in one semester. Of the two times he showed up, I tried, albeit in vain, to give him make up work. I tried to consider what could be going on at home. His excuse was that he just had trouble waking up. \nAt the end of the semester, when grades were due, I struggled a bit. I felt bad because I remember how hard school was for me. I hated waking up to go, I hated the social component. But I also understood no other teacher was showing this kid the consequences of his behavior. He literally wasn't learning anything.\nI elected to give him an F. The reality was that I was an easy teacher. I never gave homework, just focused on learning by induction, retention, and the students being able to show real-world application of the content. So he had to really try, which he did, to get an F.\nWhen we returned from Christmas break, I went to check that my grades had been processed and noticed he had been given an A. When I looked at the log, I saw that the vice principal, who had a reputation for being a complete pushover, had given him an A. When I approached the VP about this, he said the student had promised to do better the following semester - his final semester before graduation. Incredulous, I asked what he had done to make up the work. The VP explained that they had a good heart-to-heart and he felt things would turn around.\nWe cannot expect academic excellence from our students when there are administrators that inappropriately sympathize with laggard students. There are, of course, exceptions but those are just that: exceptions. \nEDIT: a few things. \nFirst, the kid wasn't an athlete. He also wasn't some entitled POS with rich parents. In fact, he was a pretty humble, kind kid with a rough upbringing who lacked parental figures to help him learn discipline. Do I know what was going on behind the scenes? Partially, yes, and I consider myself fairly objective. With what I did know, and considering this student had a sibling who did not have attendance issues, I elected to give him and F in hopes of righting the course because, again, no other teacher was doing it. So, in this sense, I guess I weaponized the grading system against him. But understand, I built my gradebook based on MY assignments that I issued. So the F wasn't arbitrary, it was based on 0s across the board.\nEDIT 2: As far as I know, he did not go on to become some deadbeat. I understand that's a popular trope for these types of stories. But the last time I talked to him, he was holding down a full-time job, not drug-addicted, and was thinking of going to a local university.\nEDIT 3: To those barking about me not escalating this to other administrators: I was being paid $11/hr, working two other jobs, and my own family to worry about. My word against this VP's would have done nothing and likely would have made my life more difficult. Or something. I don't know and I don't care. This was several years ago and this VP no longer works at that school. Instead, he works at another school with a significantly larger student population. There are no teacher unions where I live.\nEDIT 4: This was a high school in the western US, not a university.\nEDIT 5: The VP was not as sinister as it may sound. He was just very... I don't know. Empathetic? A good sob story could get you anything from this guy. He had no disciplinary bone in his body. I don't believe there was blackmail or any sort of sexual favors happening as some have suggested. In all likelihood, the kid went to his office, told a sad story about something deeply personal, and it worked. I don't believe the kid did it to leverage the VP.\nEDIT 6: Christ almighty, he was not Mexican, Black, or any other minority. He was as white as the driven snow. Go back to The_Donald if you want to engage in that rhetoric. There isn't some sweeping grading conspiracy that encourages educators to pass minorities.\nFINAL EDIT: I talked to the kid. He's doing great. Not perfect, but great all things considered. Lest we forget this post wasn't about some dead beat student. It was about an administrator that did something that, as far as I can tell, was somewhat unseemly and maybe not great for the student in the long run. In context, it also seemed to compliment the OP.",

As a substitute teacher I heard students openly claiming that they were not going to study for a test and just retake it until the got a grade they liked. \nEDIT 2: The \"gravy train\" of funds obviously doesn't go to the teachers or students.

Believe it or not Alabama was one of the hardest states to get a high school diploma in not because people were dumb, but because even if you passed all the classes if you didn't pass the 4 graduation exams you didn't get to graduate high school giving the state only about a 80% graduation rate.

                "comment_text": "I used to be a teacher, and although it wasn't THE reason I left the profession I can speak to the tension that comes with giving low grades or actual grades to students.\n\nThere is the pressure from parents, who don't understand why or how some classes can be more academically rigorous than others.  I think the most egregious schedule I ever saw from one of my students was having a shop class, my English class, and TWO weightlifting classes in a four class semester.  But I had many parents wonder why their kid's grade in the class I taught was so much lower.\nWhich is compounded by pressure created from other teachers.  At least back when I was teaching, there were a number of teachers who would give out extra credit.  Lots and lots and lots of extra credit.  To the point where tests and assessments or not turning in work didn't matter because doing your extra kindergarten level coloring sheets would end up with students having grades around 130% or 140% on the semester.  Grades so high they broke the grading software.  The worst part? Those were also in classes that had end of course tests like mine, and it's hard to make my tests feel like they matter when other classes let you nuke your low test grades with bonus points.\nAnd then there's pressure from the Administration.  I did not get the same level of flak as some of my colleagues got because I am a white male with a southern accent who was teaching in \"real America\" (including my wife, who quit teaching the year before I left).  But considering I was constantly having \"star\" athletes switched OUT of my classes as well as one episode where the administration tried to completely change my course load because people were feeling bad and...well...there were problems.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  There were times where I threw out grades when the whole class did bad because it was clear that I had somehow been deficient in teaching the material or testing on the material.  But giving zeroes for not turning in work? Unless there are some super shitty home circumstances, that's on the student.",

I'm not surprised that /r/news went knee-jerk \"schools are bad\" \"participation trophies\" nonsense, but there's a lot of actual academic discussion about this. The root of the discussion is whether the percentage-based grading system makes it impossible to come back once you've fallen behind. This means that students give up once they miss a couple of assignments. Sure, they should have turned those in and they should be penalized for it - but should the penalty be so severe that they can't get back to passing? Studies on student behavior indicate that receiving zeroes severely decreases the likelihood that a student remains engaged or trying, and decreases interest in learning.\nAlso, the numbers generally work out so that a 50% floor ends up rewarding students with better understanding. Someone who gets one zero and four 100s has an 80% average, which is not likely a real measurement of their abilities. Grades shouldn't measure things like attendance and completion, they should measure proficiency. \nThere are some side effects that aren't great, but are they worse than giving up on students who didn't turn in a few assignments? \nI don't know where I land on this, but it's an extensive and deep debate that is super interesting to dig into. Much like Facebook whining about \"common core math\" though, some people miss the point because they don't instantly understand the issue.",

The space between a perfectly proficient student who did a particularly excellent job and a kid who scribbled on paper on the bus to school is the same as between that scribbler and a kid who decided scribbling on the bus was not worthwhile.  There should be a gap, but it probably should not be so huge.\nAll of these policies and approaches are for children who struggle, and who likely do not have the foundation at home to set them up for success in school.  What they deserve in comparison to other children is much less important than what is effective in progressing their education.  They are not competing with good students.  The 100 point scale is arbitrary, especially from 0-60.  I see no value in making sure that these kids get failed as hard as possible relative to what adults think they objectively deserve.",

About the early twenties for women, and the late twenties for men. \nThis varies a little depending on economic conditions, and a little for religion and social status. But is fairly consistent.\nThe reason: men need to be old enough too have enough income/property to support a family. And women need to be old enough to safely bear children AND their father needs to be wealthy enough to afford a dowry. So the difference between 17 and 23 is six extra years to save up some cows/goats/camels/silver coins whatever.\nMany people think people married young because of noble or royal marriages. But these were meant to seal alliances, and thus followed different rules.\nEven then, the marriages weren't typically consummated until the woman was of age...anywhere from 17-20. Remember, they want heirs, and a 21 year old has better prospects at surviving pregnancy than a 14 year old.\nAs always, there will be exceptions, and plenty of commenters will point out historic examples of 13 yeah old brides with their third pregnancy.

Not only does Austin Powers look like a young Richard Branson, but he also looks like a young Peter Asher, from the band Peter and Gordon (famous for their 1964 hit single \"A World Without Love\").\nAfter John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful and then John Lennon started wearing the \"granny glasses\", the black rims went out of style very quickly. And when the Beatles and other bands grew out their hair beyond a moptop--which had happened by 1968--the world followed suit.\nAustin Powers has some elements of '70s culture, but his fashion sense itself is firmly rooted in the '60s. Just check out the stuff the Beatles were selling at the Apple Boutique, or what the bands were wearing in the Monterey Pop Festival film and you can see it. Then compare it to the fashion of the bands at Woodstock, and it's changed pretty dramatically.",

Bring in Cardi B to play one of the henchwomen who tries to kill Austin early on. His sidekick could be an androgynous Ruby Rose and he has to spend the movie tiptoeing around trying to figure out their gender and trying to figure out if he's attracted or not. A new clone henchman to replace the dearly departed Mini Me.... Maxi Me, played by The Mountain from Game of Thrones. Hijinks ensue. This stuff writes itself.  \nI'll take my check now, Mike.\nEdit: this took off... Here's edits from other comments.\nDr. Evil is now an incredibly successful, competent and savvy politician, convincing Americans that his evil energy will only be directed at America's problems and enemies from now on. There would be a back story about how he started a third party, or \"liquidated the leadership\" of the libertarian/green party and started a new party, after seeing \"the evils of greed, poverty, and pollution are greater than the evils of world conquest\" and his campaign slogan is \"you can't dominate a world if there's no world left to dominate\". \nEarly in his political career, as a freshman senator from Vermont, Senator Dr. Evil sponsored a bill that eventually became a constitutional amendment allowing naturalized citizens to run for president. The \"Schwarzenegger Amendment\" was ratified into the Constitution shortly before then-aspiring presidential candidate and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger died in a tragic accident where he was accidentally knocked overboard at a fundraiser on a yacht and was subsequently eaten by \"mutated ill-tempered seabass\" that had somehow gotten in to the Bay. That year he steps in after the totally accidental death of the front runner and after a tough campaign against James Woods he becomes president. He ushers in an era of prosperity and security and is actually popular, and his brother Austin is now his most trusted advisor and best spy when the main plot begins.",

My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.",
