## Project Overview & Documentation Structure
### In the Moment Overview
The project addresses the theme of ‘Collective Action’ and interprets it in the context of an event and activity recommendation application to encourage lifestyle enrichment in workaholics. ‘In the Moment’ is a mobile application that drives personalised event and activity recommendations for workaholics based on their time, location and selected areas of interest. It features a time-tracking feature that shows them how much free time they have been spending in contrast to the collective public on a daily basis. The intention of this feature is to encourage them in a non-intrusive manner to spend more time on doing activities that they enjoy. 

Workaholics were selected as the primary target audience as they are a time poor user group to begin with and in the few pockets of free time that they do get, they might not know what they want to do. One of the most common results of workaholism is burn-out due to physical and mental exhaustion, and this results in a variety of physical and mental health issues. By encouraging workaholics to regularly take time out to de-stress and spend a few minutes completing activities that they enjoy and may help them relax, we hope to reduce the chances of burn out occurring for these individuals. 

In the Moment is an application that is built for users' personal gain, as it uses a dynamic recommendation process to help users find more activities they can do in a much shorter time. The key focus of In the Moment is that it considers how much free time the user has on hand in that particular spot in time. The system considers the time that they input against the time that activities generally take and automatically filters out options that don't fit the criteria. The system repeats this filtering again with the user's location by considering where the user is and where the recommended activities might be. For activities that are too far away, the system will not include it in the list of recommendations. 

Having narrowed down a set of results to recommend to the user, when the user selects their preferred option the system will present them with an activity card. Depending on the activity type, this card will contain information that introduces what the activity is about. For example, if it is an activity that requires instructions, the card will include quick links to popular introductory level tutorials to give the user a low barrier of entry starting point.

### Documentation Structure
The BubbleTea...Mmm WIKI for In the Moment contains multiple pages documenting the design and build process of the application from Week 8 through to Week 13. Apart from the weekly breakdown of the team’s processes, the WIKI also includes a number of pages that are more relevant to the project as a whole. These pages fall under the ‘Key Pages’ and ‘Specifications’ category and contains documents such as the project proposal and the specification sheets from technical and UI perspectives. The documentation structure has been included below, with the links to each relevant page tied to its respective heading. For a short breakdown (in bullet point format) of what was the progress highlights for each section each week, refer to the WIKI (Home)[[https://github.com/deco3500-2018/BubbleTea...Mmm/wiki](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/BubbleTea...Mmm/wiki)] page
